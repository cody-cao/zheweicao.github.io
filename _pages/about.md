I am a graduate student in the [Multisensory Perception Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/brang-lab/) of Dr. David Brang at the University of Michigan. I  go by Cody. Currently, we're working on projects that investigates how brain represent audiovisual speech with electrocorticography (ECoG) recording from tumor and epilepsy patients, as well as lesion studies with brain tumor patients. 

Before coming to Michigan, I received my Bachelor's in Brain and Cognitive Sciences from the University of Rochester, where I worked in Dr. John Foxe & Dr. Ed Freedman's [Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/cognitive-neurophysiology.aspx), and completed an honors thesis with the [Computational Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/lalor.aspx) of Dr. Edmund Lalor. Our work provided evidence that visual cortex tracks categorical visual speech features theduring silent lipreading. Check out our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.09.430299) here !


When I'm not in lab, you can find me baking or pretending to be tasting differences in wine.
