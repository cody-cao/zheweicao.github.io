Hi ! My name is Cody.

I am a PhD student working with [Dr. David Brang](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/brang-lab/) at the University of Michigan. Currently, we're working on projects that investigate how brain represents audiovisual speech using electrocorticography (ECoG) recording from epilepsy patients, as well as lesion studies with brain tumor patients. 

Before coming to Michigan, I received my Bachelor's in Brain and Cognitive Sciences from the University of Rochester, where I worked with Dr. John Foxe & Dr. Ed Freedman's [CNL Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/cognitive-neurophysiology.aspx),and completed an honors thesis with [Dr. Edmund Lalor](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/lalor.aspx). Our work provided evidence that visual cortex tracks categorical visual speech features theduring silent lipreading. Check out our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.09.430299) here !

When I'm not in lab, I'm probably busy catering to my plants or baking !
