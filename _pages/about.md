I am an incoming graduate student at the [Multisensory Perception Laboratory](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/brang-lab/) in the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan.

In May 2020, I graduated from the University of Rochester with a Bachelor's in Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and completed an honors thesis with the [Computational Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/lalor.aspx) of Dr. Edmund C. Lalor. My thesis work demonstrated that during silent lipreading, categorical visual speech features are tracked in the visual cortex but not the auditory cortex. 

I was also a research assistant in Dr. John Foxe & Dr. Ed Freedman's [Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/cognitive-neurophysiology.aspx), working on ERP studies of illusory contour perception. Our work showed that susceptability to backward masking interference is correlated with the interval between P1 & N1 component of the ERP. 

When I'm not in lab, you can find me climbing on a wall somewhere, playing with film cameras and trying out recipes that won't set off the fire alarms.
