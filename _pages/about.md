zhewei "cody" cao's site

Hi I'm Zhewei Cao. My Chinese name is 曹哲韡. You probably know me as Cody. I am a senior in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences and a Take Five Scholar at the University of Rochester. Previously, I was a MBBS candidate at the Medical College of Soochow University and a Psychology/Photography student at SUNY Buffalo. 

Currently, I am completing an honors thesis on silent lipreading in the Computational Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab of Dr. Edmund Lalor. I'll be presenting a poster on the current project at CNS 2020 (C109).  I have also been a research assistant in Dr. John Foxe & Dr. Ed Freedman's Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab since Oct. 2017.

When I'm not in lab, you can find me climbing on a wall somewhere, playing with film cameras, trying new recipes, and pretending I can taste the differences in wine.
