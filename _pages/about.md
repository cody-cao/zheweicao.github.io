I am a first year graduate student in the [Multisensory Perception Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/brang-lab/) of Dr. David Brang at the University of Michigan. My name is pronounced /je-way/. I also go by Cody.

Before coming to Michigan, I received my Bachelor's in Brain and Cognitive Sciences from the University of Rochester, and completed an honors thesis with the [Computational Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/lalor.aspx) of Dr. Edmund Lalor. Our work showed evidence that categorical visual speech features are being tracked in the visual cortex during silent lipreading. Check out our CNS poster [here](/files/CNS2020_Final.pdf).

I was also a research assistant in Dr. John Foxe & Dr. Ed Freedman's [Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/cognitive-neurophysiology.aspx), working on studies of inihibitory control and visual perception. 

When I'm not in lab, you can find me playing with film cameras, trying different recipes or climbing on a boulder wall somewhere.
