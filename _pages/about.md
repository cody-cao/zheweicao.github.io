I am a graduate student in the [Multisensory Perception Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/brang-lab/) of Dr. David Brang at the University of Michigan. I  go by Cody.

Before coming to Michigan, I received my Bachelor's in Brain and Cognitive Sciences from the University of Rochester, and completed an honors thesis with the [Computational Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/lalor.aspx) of Dr. Edmund Lalor. Our work provided evidence that categorical visual speech features are being tracked in the visual cortex during silent lipreading. Check out our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.09.430299) here !

I was also a research assistant in Dr. John Foxe & Dr. Ed Freedman's [Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/cognitive-neurophysiology.aspx), working on studies of inihibitory control and visual perception with EEG. 

When I'm not in lab, you can find me baking or pretending to be tasting differences in wine.
