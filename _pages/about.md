I am an incoming graduate student at the [Multisensory Perception Lab](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/brang-lab/) at the University of Michigan. My name is pronounced /je-way/. I also go with Cody.

In May 2020, I graduated from the University of Rochester with a Bachelor's in Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and completed an honors thesis with the [Computational Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/lalor.aspx) of Dr. Edmund Lalor. My thesis work demonstrated that during silent lipreading, categorical visual speech features are tracked in the visual cortex. Check out my CNS poster [here](/files/CNS2020_Final.pdf).

I was also a research assistant in Dr. John Foxe & Dr. Ed Freedman's [Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/cognitive-neurophysiology.aspx), working on ERP studies of self-control among HIV/AIDS population, and illusory contour perception among healthy adults and children with ASD. 

When I'm not in lab, you can find me climbing on a wall somewhere, playing with film cameras and trying out recipes that won't set off fire alarms.
