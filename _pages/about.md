I am an incoming graduate student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan. I'll be joining the [Multisensory Perception Laboratory](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/brang-lab/). 

In May 2020, I graduated from the University of Rochester with a Bachelor's in Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and completed an honors thesis on silent lipreading in the [Computational Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/lalor.aspx) of Dr. Edmund Lalor. I was also a research assistant in Dr. John Foxe & Dr. Ed Freedman's [Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/cognitive-neurophysiology.aspx) since Oct. 2017, working on ERP studies of illusory contour perception.

When I'm not in lab, you can find me climbing on a wall somewhere and playing with film cameras.
